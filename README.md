# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

[Design preview and challenge link for the Advice generator app coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could have use any tools to complete the challenge. So I decided to build the app using reactjs, due to the simplicity of the state management. Also, it never hurts to get more practice using a 3rd-party API.

Users can:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
- Search for advice based off the api's total

v1.1.4 notes: 
- Logo updated
- Fixed search bar functionality errors
- Additional styles added
